                I am a stay-at-home mom to four children, and wife to an active-duty Sailor.
                A first-generation Dominican-American, born and raised in Miami. Before the Navy
                relocated my family to San Diego in 2018, I lived in Orlando for 12 years and began
                studying at UCF. I successfully completed a Bachelor of Science in Psychology in May
                of 2020, and a Master of Arts in Educational Leadership in August of 2022 at UCF.
                <br /><br />
                I decided to enroll in the UCF Coding Bootcamp to fulfill the desire I have always had to
                learn web development. As challenging as the program has been, I am thoroughly
                enjoying every moment of it, and am looking forward to completing the program and beginning
                my career in web development!
